# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of **7 Machine Learning projects** I have worked on, covering different techniques such as **regression**, **classification**, and **clustering**.  
Each project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** and demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and insights.
